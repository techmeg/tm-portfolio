For the most part I followed along with the Scrimba online course that
accompanied this challenge. Although the only really new feature for me was how
to accessibly manage tab panels, I was curious to learn some best practice for
organizing the CSS. I was not crazy about the method for managing type sizes and
for me, there were too many utility classes, but it was an interesting exercise.
