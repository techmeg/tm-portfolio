This site was originally originally made as a skills test during my time at the BNY Mellon bootcamp. I have since improved the UX, styling and accessibility, but the gist of the site remains the same. Including JQuery was a requirement, so there are a few odd bits, including a link that opens a window to a hilarious French blog site, which shocked my cohort a bit. I also exercised my sense of humor by inventing a few daffynitions to throw into the cat facts page.
