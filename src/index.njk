        <p class="welcome-text"> I am a career project manager who has turned to web development for fun and career expansion. I get a kick out of making the front end look pretty, although I'm interested in rooting around the back end too. My goal is to get as much coding in as possible, while using my organization skills to help the trains run on time.</p>
